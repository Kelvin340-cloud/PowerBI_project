This is a project to analyze survey data and shed light on gender inequality in water access in Maji Ndogo. The goal is to use the power of data to make overlooked truths visible and compelling, prompting action. The message emphasizes the importance of thoughtful design choices in creating visual stories using Power BI. 
Key insights from previous analyses reveal rural water sources, shared tap usage, non-functional home infrastructure, and challenges with wells. The team aims to visually represent these findings to enhance understanding and prompt strategic action in addressing the water crisis in Maji Ndogo.
The analysis begins at the national-level survey results, aiming to create visuals that convey high-level insights about water access in Maji Ndogo. The identified insights to be communicated include the rural versus urban population distribution, the significant usage of shared taps by 43% of the population, the presence of water infrastructure in 31% of homes, and the utilization of wells by 18% of the population. 
Starting with a pie chart, it illustrates the split between urban and rural populations using the total number of people served. Additionally, a bar chart is created to represent the population using various water sources, with considerations to avoid duplicate records by filtering with the visit_count variable. Despite intentionally choosing a challenging color palette and anticipating mistakes for educational purposes, the leader acknowledges the effectiveness of pie charts in telling the "part of a whole" story, particularly in highlighting the substantial rural population in Maji Ndogo.
I successfully uses the visuals to convey information about shared taps in urban and rural areas. Next, I delve into mapping broken water infrastructure across provinces, utilizing a custom map and images of Maji Ndogo. The Shape map visual is customized, highlighting provinces where tap_in_home is broken. To enhance clarity, an image of Maji Ndogo's map is overlaid on the visual, emphasizing the broken infrastructure locations.
In this segment, I examined queue times in Maji Ndogo through various Power BI visuals. A new page is created with four key visuals to analyze average queue times, hourly patterns, queue composition, and the relationship between the number of people served and average time in the queue. The analysis highlights significant queue lengths on Saturdays and distinct queue patterns during weekdays versus weekends.
The visuals reveal nuanced details such as shorter queues on Saturdays between 11 AM and 6 PM. The clustered bar chart indicates a gender disparity, with women queuing more consistently than men, particularly on weekends. The data connects these findings to a broader societal issues, referencing reports on women's roles as primary water collectors and the associated challenges they face.
The scatter plot becomes instrumental in decision-making, illustrating the linear relationship between queue length and time taken, informing the installation of additional taps to reduce wait times. However, the data plateaus around 3000 people served, suggesting that excessive queue lengths might lead people to seek water elsewhere. Additionally, the team introduces crime-related data, encouraging exploration of the link between queue lengths and crime occurrences, providing a holistic understanding of water access challenges in Maji Ndogo.
