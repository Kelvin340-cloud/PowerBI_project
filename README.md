This project uses data analysis to expose gender inequality in Maji Ndogo's water crisis. It reveals extensive reliance on unreliable water sources, especially in rural areas where infrastructure is limited. Visuals showcase the high dependency on shared taps (43%), non-functional home infrastructure (69%), and well usage (18%).

The analysis goes beyond water access demographics, delving into queue times. Visuals highlight significantly longer waits on Saturdays and for women, particularly on weekends. The data suggests a clear correlation between queue length and wait time, potentially informing the need for more taps. Crime data is also introduced to paint a holistic picture of Maji Ndogo's water challenges.

Overall, this project aims to drive action by making invisible inequalities visible and using data-driven insights to inform strategic solutions for equitable water access in Maji Ndogo.
